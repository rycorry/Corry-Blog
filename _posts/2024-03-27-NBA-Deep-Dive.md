## The Impact of Free Throws

### Where I Got This Data

I am an **AVID** NBA fan. I love the game of basketball; I could watch it all day every day. Part of what drew me to being a stats major was my love of the NBA and how interesting the stats side of the game of basketball really is. There are plenty of advanced stats like a player +/- or a player PER or Players Efficiency Rating. I got the base for my new data set from <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nba/stats/overall.php" target="_blank">Fantasy Pros</a>. This base data set included a lot of base stats like points, rebounds, and assists for every player in the NBA. Once I was able to web scrape this base data, I wanted to research the very controversial stat of the free throw line. A common complaint of NBA fans is that certain players manipulate the rules to get to the free throw line more than they should and it is a negative to the game. So, I decided to take a deep dive into the stats behind the free throw line to see if that claim holds any weight!
