## Why I Code

### My First Experience with Coding

Hello, my name is Ryan Corry. I am a senior at Brigham Young University in Provo Utah. I am studying Statistics with an emphasis in Data Science. I had my first interaction with coding in middle school when I took a simple computer science class where we utilized a beginner coding program that we used to make fun little games on. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and thought coding was a blast. Then I went to college, my roommate was a computer science major and after seeing the kind of assignments he was doing, I was sure that coding was not in the cards for me.

### First Real Experience with Code

After a couple years of avoiding coding like the plague, I decided to try some real code for myself. I took the most basic computer science class that BYU had to offer. It was a beginner class in C++ which I had **ZERO** experience in. The closest experience I had to learning C++ for the first time was when I was first learning Spanish in high school. I felt completely lost at first and had no idea what I was doing. But, after the first couple assignments I started to get the hang of it. I realized that coding was going to be hard, but it was also like a puzzle that I could solve, and it was **VERY** satisfying feeling when I solved the puzzle. There were many late nights and frustrating days, but the feeling when the code ran correctly felt amazing. I had finally started to enjoy coding.

### Learning to Code for Statistics

Leaving my first coding class with some momentum, I took the next step and took a class on how to use code to help with my statistical studies. I took a class that taught me how to code in R Studio, a very common tool for statistics. Learning a second coding language proved to me how accurate the analogy to learning Spanish really was. I started to get C++ and R code mixed up and struggled at first to pick it up. But, thanks to practice, hard work, and a great teacher. I was able to see just how powerful R was going to be. It made life as a statistic major so much easier. It was fun to learn just what I was able to do with the R and what I was able to create. The options seemed endless to me. The best part about learning a great skill like coding in R is that there is always more to learn. I still feel to this day that I am finding new tools within R Studio that make life easier and easier.

### Powerful Python

After learning C++ and R, I now was tasked with learning my third coding language, Python. Arguably the most powerful of coding languages, Python is viewed as having almost unlimited potential and is very user friendly and easy to master. While there were definitely some of those same challenges that I experienced when learning R, mixing up the three languages that I have now had experiences with. Python definitely was the easiest to pick up and learn, it was very evident to me how powerful and useful Python was going to be. The ease that python can make charts and utilize data was amazing to see. After seeing how powerful Python was, I took an online class as I tried to master this skill. While I am nowhere near a master at Python, it was very useful to learn this skill and obvious to me how much I will use Python in my life.

### Why You Should Code!

It is cool to look back at my experience with coding, going from a young kid just making weird games in middle school, to someone who didn't want anything to do with code, to where I am now as someone who codes every day and is enjoying learning more and more. If I was to give any advice, I would just say try it. See where coding can take you and see what you are able to do. I never imagined that I would enjoy coding as much as I am, but once I learned how useful it is, I can confidently say how glad I am that I changed my mind and started to learn code. So, see what coding can do, see how coding can make your life easier.
