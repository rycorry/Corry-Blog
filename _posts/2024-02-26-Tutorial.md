## Why I Code

### My First Experience with Coding

Hello, my name is Ryan Corry. I am a senior at Brigham Young University in Provo Utah. I am studying Statistics with an emphasis in Data Science. I had my first interaction with coding in middle school when I took a simple computer science class where we utilized a beginner coding program that we used to make fun little games on. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and thought coding was a blast. Then I went to college, my roommate was a computer science major and after seeing the kind of assignments he was doing, I was sure that coding was not in the cards for me.
